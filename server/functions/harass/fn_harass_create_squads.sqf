	Description:
		This function should not be called outside of the AI subsystem.
		Maintains the dynamic harass squads that attack players in the field.
		Sets a 'harass level' on players, to mark how harassed they are right now. '1' is the target.
		Less than 1 is under-harassed, more than 1 is over-harassed.

	Parameter(s): none

	Returns: nothing
